**A BicycleClub Application**

A simple project to illustrate some JPA
The project design and objectives are as follows:

**Entities:**

Member: a cyclist who is a member of the bicycle club. This entity will have attributes like name, email, address, and phone number.
Profile: a cyclist has a profile which will include address and bio
Bike: represents a bike owned by a member. attributes like bike make, model, and year.
Ride: represents a ride taken by a member. This entity would have attributes like distance, time, date, and route.

**Relationships:**

A member has one profile (one-to-one relationship between Member and Profile).
A member will own multiple bikes (one-to-many relationship between Member and Bike).
A member will take multiple rides (one-to-many relationship between Member and Ride).

The BicycleClub application will use Spring Boot to create a REST API to perform CRUD operations on these entities, Spring Data JPA to persist data to a database
For testing, JUnit and Mockito for unit tests and integration tests. 
Postman to test API endpoints.
The simple goal - GitHub code to demonstrate one-to-many and one-to-one relationships, as well as using Spring Data JPA for persistence, and tests
It will use Swagger UI to document the REST API.

**Integration Tests**

create an instance of Spring Boot application in the test code, 
Configure it to use a test database. 
Test data to verify the functionality.

**Test API endpoints:**

Spring's TestRestTemplate to send HTTP requests to the application's API endpoints. 
Verify responses returned are as expected
Verify data sent in the request is correctly processed and saved to the test database.

**Test business logic:** 

Test any business logic of the application. 
e.g test a member's performance is correctly calculated based on their ride data
or that a member's bike is correctly associated with them in the database.

**Test error handling:** 

test how the application handles error conditions, such as invalid input or missing data. 
e.g. check for a 400 Bad Request response if a required field is missing in a POST request.

**Cleanup:**

Clean up any test data created during the test run, and ensure that the test database is left in a clean state for the next test run.
Overall, integration tests should aim to verify the functionality and correctness of the BicycleClub application as a whole, by testing its API endpoints 
and business logic together in a realistic scenario.
